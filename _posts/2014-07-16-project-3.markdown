description: For autonomous robots to see wide spread deployment in commerical and non commerical settings, they should be capable of achieving failure free operation for long durations of time. This objective though relatively well defined in controlled industrial settings, it is extremely hard to accomplish in unstructured human environments. Given the complexity of unstructured human environments, designing systems capable of failure free operation is a problem that is both complex and illposed. This is due to the fact that there are an innumerable number of failure cases, and the algorithms underlying autonomous systems cannot be designed to explicitly enumerate and address all these cases. These limitations have long been a barrier for adoption of robots in non-industrial settings. Hence, in order to deploy robots in non industrial settings a practical trade-off is to design systems that can either fail gracefully (i.e avoid damaging critical infrastructure) or query an expert in the event of an unmodeled source of uncertainty during the course of decision making. </br> <iframe width="480" height="300" style="padding:10px;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q6vQcKP76DI" frameborder="0" align="right" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> Much of my research in this domain has been focused on developing learning mechanisms for robust failure recovery in autonomous systems. <img src="img/portfolio/shared_autonomy_interfaces.gif" class="img-responsive img-centered" style="width:50%;height:50%" alt="image-alt">Such that these systems are capable of querying an expert in the event of unmodeled sources of uncertainty. Some of my previous research in this area has been published in IROS 2012. There I developed shared autonomy algorithms for mobile manipulators such that they could execute robust failure recovery behaviors with limited expert intervention. More recently I have been interested in further enhancing these systems for deployment in real world unstructured environments outside the lab.
