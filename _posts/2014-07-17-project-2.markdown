description: Exploiting the movement of mobile sensors to improve the estimate of the target they are sensing is a well studied problem in active sensing.
             Building on this line of work, mobile robots can similarly be treated as mobile sensors and the problem of state estimation can be treated as one of active information acquisition.
             Then similar to <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8007233">Interactive Perception</a>, tools from <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y6uzqpox">information acquistion</a>
             can be exploited to solve the state estimation problem as an action selection problem that reduces uncertainty regarding the target
             quantity being estimated.

             Active perception as a tool to improve state estimation was first introduced in robotics by <a href="https://tinyurl.com/ydcddf8n">Basjcy. R</a> in the 80s.
             Since then, this field has been extensively studied using tools from optimal control and decision making to solve a myriad of

             While in academia I used active perception methods to solve complex problems in 3D object recognition.
             I am particularly interested in solving visual recognition problems in environments that are plagued with occlusions, dynamic obstacles and variations in appearance.
             In ICRA 2013 and TRO-14, my collaborators and I formulated a novel non myopic view selection algorithm for improving <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y9c2amnj" target="_blank">3D object recognition</a>.
             More recently, apart from 3D object recognition, I have been using tools from active perception to solve problems in 3D SLAM and coverage planning.
