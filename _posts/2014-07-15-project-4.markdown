description: Recognizing salient objects and estimating their pose accurately, can tremendously benefit autonomous robots in modeling their environment. <img src="img/portfolio/FeatureExtraction.jpg" class="img-responsive img-left" align="right" style="width:40%;height:40%" hspace="10"> Such semantic parsing is significant for scene understanding. The output of the scene understanding, in turn can act as input for systems performing Active Perception, Interactive Perception, SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), Manipulation or Visual Navigation. </br> The current state-of-the-art in 3D recognition systems can perform inference using both texture and depth information. The open challenges in this domain still lie in recognizing relevant objects under heavy occlusion and clutter, apart from having to deal with noise in sensing. <img src="img/portfolio/3d_perception_resized.jpg" class="img-responsive img-left" align="left" style="width:40%;height:40%" hspace="10">I spent a large part of my academic career researching 3D object recognition under heavy clutter and occlusion from sensory data that provides both texture and depth information. This allowed the recognition system to also be robust to sensing noise and variations in lighting. These 3D recognition systems were developed to service indoor mobile manipulators. More recently, I have focused on extending these approaches to classes of objects where the interclass variations are either not pronounced or the environments have very uniform texture.
