description: <h3> The current state of robotics </h3> <p style="font-size:100%; text-align:justify"> Robotics research has seen rapid progress in academia over the last decade, thanks primarily to advances in standardization. This includes algorithms, software and hardware alike. Despite this progress, robots are yet to see large scale deployment in non-industrial settings. Most robots still remain confined to controlled industrial settings like manufacturing floors and sorting centers; or esoteric applications like space exploration. </br> The reason this progress has not translated from academia to industry is two fold. Firstly, human environments are extremely complex and unstructured. Robotic capabilities though vastly advanced compared to a decade ago, are still not mature enough to be deployed in settings where they are expected to exhibit <a href "https://rodneybrooks.com/blog/" ><b>strong artificial intelligence</b></a> or <a href "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence" ><b>A.G.I</b></a>. Currently the most hyped use cases for robotics are autonomous driving and service robotics. Both these problems fall under the <b>A.G.I</b> domain, due to the vast set of decision making and reasoning problems they entail. The second (<i>non-technical</i>) reason why robots have still not seen wide spread adoption (outside controlled industrial settings), is the lack of a direct value value proposition. The cost to benefit value chain in most current robotics applications is not straight forward as either the <b>cost of technology is exorbitant compared to the problem it is solving </b> or the <b>quality of existing solution available to the end user is far superior to automated one</b>. These being primary reasons among many others, have prevented robotic technologies from seeing wide spread adoption. </br> This inspired me to find an application for robotics that would have a genuine wide spread impact on an industry and hence the wider world we live. Solving real problems that affect real people is the only way such an objective can be accomplished. While developing this insight was when I met Stuart Maggs. An architect who had a problem with construction and was on a similar mission. </br> </p> <p style="font-size:100%; text-align:justify"> <h3> The Problem with Construction </h3> </p> <p style="font-size:100%; text-align:justify"> Construction one of the world's largest industries is also one of its most polluting. There are estimates that nearly a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/construction-waste"> <b>third</b> </a> of every construction project is ends up in a landfill and the entire industry on average operates on a <b>1~2%</b> margin due to waste and rework. The root of this problem lies in the fact that, despite making incredible progress in digital design we still construct buildings with outdated manual tools. At <a href="www.scaledrobotics.com"><b>Scaled Robotics</b></a>, we are on a mission to modernize construction with the help of Robotics and A.I.</p> <h3>A genuine target application for Robotics</h3> <p style="font-size:100%; text-align:justify"> Construction is one of the ultimate mobile manipulation problems. Autonomous robots attempting to build structures, not only need to solve the problem of mobile manipulation but also need to be able to localize themselves against the structures they are building. Apart from this, they also need to be able to accurately map the structure they are building in order to compare it to the intended 3D model. This will enable the robot to effectively close the loop around manipulation and perception. These aspects of the problem make it a very interesting application of integrated perception, learning and control.</br> Leveraging my decade plus experience in robotics research and industry automation, I am fortunate to lead an <a href="https://www.scaledrobotics.com/"> <b><i> amazing team of architects, engineers and scientists </i></b></a> at Scaled Robotics, where we are solving problems in construction using Robotics and A.I. Many of the problems in robotic construction directly relate to my prior experience, in <i><b> mobile manipulation, 3D perception, visual navigation, shared autonomy, interactive & active perception </b></i>.</p> <img src="img/logos/Logo_plain_Yellow.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" style="width:20%;height:20%"> <h3>Technology at Scaled Robotics</h3> <p style="font-size:100%; text-align:justify"> Using the advances in the aforementioned fields, at Scaled Robotics we are working on a set of interesting problems to solve the construction challenges of today.
