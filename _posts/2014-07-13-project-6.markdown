description: <h3> The current state of robotics </h3> <p style="font-size:100%; text-align:justify"> Robotics research has seen rapid progress in academia over the last decade, thanks primarily to advances in standardization. This includes algorithms, software and hardware alike. Despite this progress, robots are yet to see large scale deployment in non-industrial settings. Most robots still remain confined to controlled industrial settings like manufacturing floors and sorting centers; or esoteric applications like space exploration. </br> The reason this progress has not translated from academia to industry is two fold. Firstly, human environments are extremely complex and unstructured. Robotic capabilities though vastly advanced compared to a decade ago, are still not mature enough to be deployed in settings where they are expected to exhibit artificial general intelligence <a href "https://rodneybrooks.com/blog/" ><b>(AGI)</b></a>. Currently the most hyped use cases for robotics are autonomous driving and service robotics. Both these problems fall under the <b>AGI</b> domain, due to the vast set of decision making and reasoning problems they entail. The second (<i>non-technical</i>) reason why robots have still not seen wide spread adoption (outside controlled industrial settings), is the lack of a direct value proposition. The cost to benefit value chain in most current robotics applications is not straight forward as either the <b>cost of technology is exorbitant compared to the problem it is solving </b> or the <b>quality of existing solution available to the end user is far superior to automated one</b>. These being primary reasons among many others, have prevented robotic technologies from seeing wide spread adoption. </br> This inspired me to find an application for robotics that would have a genuine wide spread impact on an industry and hence the wider world we live. Solving real problems that affect real people is the only way such an objective can be accomplished. While developing this insight was when I met Stuart Maggs. An architect who had a problem with construction and was on a similar mission. </br> </p> <p style="font-size:100%; text-align:justify"> <h3> The Problem with Construction </h3> </p> <p style="font-size:100%; text-align:justify"> Construction one of the world's largest industries is also one of its most polluting. There are estimates that nearly a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/construction-waste"> <b>third</b> </a> of every construction project is ends up in a landfill and the entire industry on average operates on a <b>1~2%</b> margin due to waste and rework. The root of this problem lies in the fact that, despite making incredible progress in digital design the process of construction is still plagued by outdated tools and workflows. This leads to very poor process control, thereby causing a lot of waste and inefficiency within the construction process. At <a href="www.scaledrobotics.com"><b>Scaled Robotics</b></a>, we are on a mission to modernize construction with Robotics and A.I. We are building tools that can track, analyze and optimize construction processes to reduce waste and inefficiencies.</p> <h3>A genuine target application for Robotics</h3> <p style="font-size:100%; text-align:justify">Construction like any other manufacturing industry with one <i>major caveat</it>. In traditional manufacturing the object being manufactured moves through the manufacturing plant, whereas in construction, the plant moves through the object. This naturally makes it very hard to measure the construction process, in turn affecting the ability to implement efficient process control.</br> Leveraging my decade plus experience in robotics research and industry automation, I am fortunate to lead an <a href="https://www.scaledrobotics.com/team"> <b><i> amazing team of computer scientists, mathematicians, engineers and architects </i></b></a> at Scaled Robotics, where we are solving these problems in construction leveraging the state of the art in robotics and artificial intelligence. Many of the problems in robotic construction directly relate to my prior experience, in <i><b> perception, learning and control</b></i>. <i> You can find out more about what we do by clicking our logo below</i>.</p> <img src="img/logos/Logo_plain_Yellow.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" href="https://www.scaledrobotics.com" style="width:50%;height:50%">
